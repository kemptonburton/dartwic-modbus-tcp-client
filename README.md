# dartwic-modbus-tcp-client

Modbus TCP device discovery, read/write tasks, and module configuration for DARTWIC.

The Engine and Interface SDK snapshots are bundled under `engine/include/sdk` and
`interface/sdk`. Run `npm ci` after cloning; no private DARTWIC checkout is needed
for the interface build. Packaging verifies `sdk-lock.json` before building.

## Settings storage

Version 1.0.2 saves discovery overrides to the workspace's
`global_data/settings.json`, under `plugins.modbus_tcp_client.device_discovery`.
The installed `plugin.json` remains the default configuration. This settings UI
requires the updated storage-enabled development Engine; the original public
Engine beta.3 download does not implement the new settings operations. Live
discovery/read/write tasks do not call the new native SDK virtual methods.

## Layout

- `plugin.json`
  - single source manifest for the engine and interface sides
  - declares `minEngineVersion` and `minInterfaceVersion`
- `versions.json`
  - generated compatibility history keyed by released plugin version
- `engine/`
  - source for the engine plugin DLL
  - `src/module_config.json` describes the module name, title, icon, and description
  - `src/default_parameters.json` contains the default parameter values for newly created module instances
- `interface/`
  - source for the interface plugin
- `plugin/`
  - generated release output only

## Build

- Initialize the bundled `vcpkg` submodule after clone:
  - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Interface: run `npm run build`
- Engine: configure and build the root `CMakeLists.txt`, or use the provided package/deploy commands

The outputs are written to:

- `plugin/engine/modbus_tcp_client`
- `plugin/engine-debug/modbus_tcp_client` when built in Debug or during `npm run package`
- `plugin/interface/modbus_tcp_client`

## Versioning and packaging

- `npm version patch|minor|major|<exact-version>` updates `package.json`, syncs `plugin.json`, and records the current compatibility floor in `versions.json`
- `npm run package` builds release engine, attempts debug engine, builds interface when present, and writes `plugin.zip`
- `npm run package -- 0.8.1` bumps to that exact version before packaging

`deployment-settings.json` controls explicit deploy targets:

- `engine_dir`: engine root that receives `plugins/<plugin-id>`
- `interface_dir`: interface root that receives `plugins/<plugin-id>`

Deploy commands:

- `npm run deploy` builds and deploys the release engine variant plus the interface plugin
- `npm run deploy:engine-debug` builds and deploys only the debug engine variant
- `npm run deploy:debug` builds and deploys the debug engine variant plus the interface plugin
- `npm run deploy:interface` builds and deploys only the interface plugin

Build behavior:

- plain `cmake` engine builds never copy into external DARTWIC plugin directories
- plain `npm run build` never copies into external DARTWIC plugin directories
- only the explicit `deploy*` commands copy to paths from `deployment-settings.json`

## Runtime Model

- The engine plugin is a singleton plugin object loaded from `plugins/modbus_tcp_client`.
- Its one Caesar discovery loop checks explicit `device_discovery.targets` and can also sweep bounded local or configured IPv4 CIDRs from `device_discovery.network_scan`. Closed ports are rejected by a short TCP probe before any read-only Modbus requests are sent.
- Automatic local scanning defaults to port `502`, a `/24` minimum prefix, and at most 254 hosts per subnet. Additional CIDRs, ports, unit IDs, timeout, and host limit are configurable from the plugin settings page. No discovery request writes to a Modbus device.
- It registers the Modbus task types on plugin load.
- It exposes local module type `tcp_client`, qualified by DARTWIC as
  `modbus_tcp_client.tcp_client`.
- It exposes task types `modbus_tcp_client.read` and
  `modbus_tcp_client.write`.
- Module instances live separately under `modules/*.json`.

## Compatibility

- engine loading is gated by `minEngineVersion`
- interface loading is gated by `minInterfaceVersion`
- both generated plugin output folders copy the root `plugin.json`
- release DARTWIC consumes only `plugin/engine/modbus_tcp_client`
- debug DARTWIC consumes only `plugin/engine-debug/modbus_tcp_client`
- there is no fallback between release and debug engine variants
